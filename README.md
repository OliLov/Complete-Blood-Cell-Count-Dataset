# CBC Dataset in Various Machine Learning Formats

Welcome to the CBC (Complete Blood Cell Count) Dataset in various machine learning formats repository. This repository provides the CBC dataset in different machine learning-ready formats, making it easier for researchers and developers to integrate this valuable data into their machine learning projects.

## Dataset Description

The CBC dataset contains comprehensive information about blood cell counts, which is crucial in medical research and diagnosis. This dataset is offered in multiple formats to suit different machine learning models and frameworks.

## Available Formats

We have converted the CBC dataset into the following formats for your convenience:

- **YOLO Format**: This format is commonly used for object detection tasks in machine learning.
- **PASCAL VOC XML Format**: This format follows the PASCAL VOC standard, which is widely used in computer vision tasks.
